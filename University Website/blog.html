                <h2>Undergraduate Certificate</h2>
                <p>Dublin City University's new undergraduate certificates are designed as building blocks for our associate, bachelor and even master-level degree programs. After finishing one of these certificates, you can seamlessly apply the credits you earned to a certificate's subsequent degree programs –– all while earning recognition that you can place on your resume immediately.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Post-Baccalaureate Certificate</h2>
                <p>In order to pursue a post-baccalaureate certificate at Dublin City  University, you must have first earned a bachelor-level degree. This certificate will consist of bachelor-level courses, but no specific prior knowledge is necessary. So, let's say you graduated with a bachelor in business but want to learn more about legal studies, the post-baccalaureate certificate is perfect for you.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Graduate Certificate</h2>
                <p>Unlike the post-baccalaureate certificate above, the courses that you'll take in the graduate certificate are graduate-level courses. This means that in order to pursue a graduate certificate at Dublin City University, you must first have received the necessary foundational knowledge by completing a relevant bachelor-level program.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Post-Graduate Certificate</h2>
                <p>A post-graduate certificate is a certificate that can only be completed after you have already earned a graduate degree. These certificate programs are great for expanding upon the knowledge you learned in your graduate program to help launch or advance your career in a specific area of interest.</p>
